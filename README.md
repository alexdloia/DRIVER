# DRIVER
Drought and Rain Investigation through Visual and Environmental Representations (DRIVER) is a spatial-centric web app focused on evaluating and predicting the effect of climate transition on long-term drought and near-term precipitation and flood patterns. Many thanks to Brent Porter at the Mid-American Geospatial Information Center (MAGIC) based in the Center for Space Research at UT Austin for mentoring throughout this project's development and graciously hosting the web app at magic.csr.utexas.edu/sees2017/alex as part of the 2017 NASA SEES internship. Additional thanks to my fellow interns for their constant support and cooperation.
